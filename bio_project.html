        <h3><u>Primary Structure</u></h3>

		<p>The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. This is determined by the gene (DNA) that encodes it.</p>

        <h3><u>Secondary Structure</u></h3>

		<p>The α-helix and β-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen
           bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone.</p>

        <h3><u>Protein Denaturation & Renaturation</u></h3>

		<p> Denaturation occurs when a protien is subjected to a changes in temperature, ph, salt concentration, or ion concentation, its protien structure may change shape while maintaining primary structure. 
		Ph will affect the H+ and OH- concentrations which will affect the strength of H and ionic bonds. High enough temperatures can break all kind of bonds. Finnally the salt or ion concentration changes will affect
		ionic and hydrogen bonds. </p>
		<img src="BioImages/Denaturation.PNG" alt="Denaturation">
		<p> Denaturation is often reversible as the primary structure of the protiens is left unchanged. If the cause the the denaturation is removed, the protien will go through renaturation and gain its original shape back.</p>

                <h3>Navier-Stokes</h3>

                <p>The Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the motion of fluids. They are a direct application of Newton's
                    Second Law to fluids. The two equations for Navier-Strokes are: </p>

                </p>
                <p>This equation describes the change in velocity vector over time (acceleration). For this reason, it's usually
                    called the
                    <i>momentum equation</i>. The four terms on the right side are a combination of accelerations, three of
                    which being differential equations that we must solve. These four terms (from left to right) are advection,
                    pressure, diffusion, and external forces.

                                The difference of pressures creates an imbalance which causes acceleration. And then to measure
                                the pressure imbalances we use the negative gradient, which you can see in the pressure component.</p>

                    The purpose of this equation is to ensure that our fluid abides by the conservation of mass. Also, the
                    reason we state that the fluid is incompressible is because it simplifies the math (don't need to solve
                    entire continuity equation) while still providing an accurate approximation. In reality all fluids are
                    compressible, but they're typically only compressed under extreme conditions (e.g. sonic booms).

                        <sup>2</sup> = 25</i> the level set would be all the x,y pairs that satisfy the equation. In this specific
                    example that describes a circle with radius of 5, the level set would be all the points along the circle's
                    boundary. You may see how level sets can be used to implicitly define surfaces.</p>

                <h3>Marching Cubes</h3>
                <p>Marching Cubes is an algorithm to extract a mesh from a scalar field. For the purposes of my fluid simulation,
                    the algorithm is used to create the solid's surface from the signed distance field. How the algorithm
                    works is you first divide an object into a grid of cubes. At each cube, you test its corners to see if
                    they're in the object. If part of a cube's corner is inside the object and the other part is outside,
                    then we know that the object's surface passes through the cube. With this information, we can draw the
                    surface of an object by forming lines between all points where the surface interesects the cubes. Basic
                    Marching Cubes results may look something like this:</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <h3>Part 1: Basic Fluid Simulation</h3>
        <p>As mentioned in the description, you can model a solid melting by representing it as a highly viscous solid. A preliminary
            step for this process is creating a simulation for fluid flow, otherwise the solid wouldn't move like a liquid
            when it melts. So for this step the bulk of the work was solving the Navier-Stokes equation. To put it shortly,
            this basically involved solving advection, diffusion, and pressure using numerical integration (Gauss-Seidel
            method) and then applying external forces (gravity and/or user input). On top of this I had to handle boundary
            conditions (will discuss later) and ensure that the incompressibility condition is maintained on each step of
            the simulation.
        </p>

        <p>When creating a fluid simulation, an important decision is whether to model motion with a Langrangian or Eulerian
            approach. In a Langrangian simulation, fluid is modeled through particles where the path of each particle must
            be traced individually. This is quite expensive and creates challenges due to the need to handle collisions.
            For my purposes, I chose a Eulerian approach due to ease of implementation. In the Eulerian approach, you instead
            have a vector field and measure changes at each point in the field. Here's a good quote that describes the differences
            with an analogy:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/fluidsimulation/fluids_notes.pdf">
            <p>"One way to think of the two viewpoints is in doing a weather report. In the Lagrangian viewpoint you’re in a
                balloon floating along with the wind, measuring the pressure and temperature and humidity etc. of the air
                that’s flowing alongside you. In the Eulerian viewpoint you’re stuck on the ground, measuring the pressure
                and temperature and humidity etc. of the air that’s flowing past."

        <p>Once I created the basic fluid simulation, I rendered the velocity field. Here are the results for this step:</p>

        <h3>Part 2: Making Smoke</h3>
        Creating smoke wasn't necessarily required to reach my goals, but I consider it a good milestone (also it looks really cool).
        By simulating smoke, I received assurance that my fluid sim was mostly correct. To create smoke, all I had to do
        was create some density field and advect the densities along the velocity field. Then to render the smoke, I use
        the density values as the alpha term in my fragment shader. Results:

        </video>
        <h3>Part 3: Creating a Surface</h3>
        <p>After implementing smoke, the next step was to enforce a boundary around my fluid. Prior to this I attempted to create
            a melting effect on the density field (tried to melt the smoke), but I was unable to get good results. There
            are numerous papers describing different methods on how to represent a fluid's surface, but my goal for this
            project was to use the most basic method. The most popular method seems to be a Lagrangian method where particles
            define the surface, but I instead chose a Eulerian surface tracker simply because this allowed me to reuse much
            of my code from part 1. The method I use is a level set method that uses a signed distance function to track
            the surface. For each cell in the simulation grid, I store a signed distance value. The sign of the distance
            for a given cell indicates whether the cell is inside or outside the fluid. The (absolute) value of the signed
            distance describes the distance from a cell to the closest point on the surface. This method is illustrated in
            the image below: </p>

        <center>
            <img src="images/signed_dist.png" class="video-table" max-width="180">
        </center>
        <p>As you can see, there is no need to explicity keep track of the fluid'ss surface. We know if a cell is inside the
            fluid if its distance is negative and outside if it's positive. Furthermore, we know if the surface lies between
            two cells if their signs differ. With these facts, we have all the information needed to create the liquid/solid
            surface. Then to render the fluid, I use a basic Marching Cubes algorithm (described in the Background section).
            To generate a smooth surface I interpolate the distance between cells. There are many optimizations for the Marching
            Cubes algorithm, but for my project a basic version was satisfactory.
        </p>

        <p>The last part of this step was adding surface deformation. This was surprisingly easy and all I had to do was advect
            the signed distances along the velocity field. The results for this part are shown in the following video:</p>

        </video>

        <h3>Part 4: "Melting"</h3>
        <p> To simulate temperature change, I created a simple heat boundary that expands in a uniform radius over time. At each
            cell in the simulation, I store an initial viscosity value. Then for each time step, if a given cell is within
            the heat boundary its viscosity is decreased by some constant. The viscosity value represent the kinematic viscosity
            value
            <i>v</i> used in the diffusion component (
            <img class="inline-image" style="display:inline;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px"
                src="images/viscosity.png" max-width="100" />) of the Navier-Stokes equation. Therefore as the viscosity lowers, the velocity at that cell will be allowed
            to diffuse more, and thus causing the solid to eventually flow like a liquid. The correct approach would be to
            solve the heat equation, and this would not have been a big challenge (very similar to Navier-Stokes equation
            1), but I never found the time to implement this. The results of my technique can be seen in the video below.

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>Besides the ordinary physics and OpenGL errors, I had some other issues that I consider noteworthy</p>
        <p>The main issue that remains unsolved is volume loss. I initially believed this to a result of incorrect boundary
            conditions, so I spent a large amount of time tinkering with different conditions. My first attempt was based
            off of an intuitive understanding of liquids in a box. When a liquid moves horizontally towards a wall, the horizontal
            velocity is reversed (from hitting the wall) and the vertical velocity remains unchanged (so that it can move
            up the wall). My next attempt involved always reversing velocities, but this didn't resolve the issue. And then
            the result that appeared most correct was setting 0 velocity at the boundaries. However, volume loss continued
            to be extreme.</p>

        <p> The videos below show 3 different attempts at fixing boundary conditions.

            <p>As you can see, different boundary conditions have varying effects on volume loss, but the issue clearly cannot
                be solved by improving the boundaries this way. The source of the issue is likely a result of using signed
                distance to keep track of surface. A signed distance field keeps no track of the solid's volume, and even
                if you do keep track of the volume, correcting the error is quite difficult. Furthermore, when you advect
                signed distances, you destroy the inherent property that the distances represent the closest distances to
                the surface. Therefore, everytime signed distance is advected, you need to redistance the field. In my code,
                I did not implement anything to correct these issues due to time constraints.</p>

            <p>On top of advecting the signed distance, numerical error also likely contributes to volume loss. In the simulation,
                the acceleration from gravity will always be a constant -9.81. However, the acceleration due to pressure
                suffers from numerical inaccuracy. This is due to the fact that an iterative solver is used to approximate
                the pressure. Therefore at each timestep, this numerical error may result in gravity dominating the acceleration
                from pressure and causing volume loss. This effect is illustrated in the image below.

            <p>Another issue is the lack of dripping when the solid melts. This seems to be a result of my naive heat model
                as well as volume loss. Had I correctly modeled heat diffusion, heat would travel (like a fluid) through
                the material, which I believe would solve the problem where the solid justs moves to the right rather than
                drips down.
